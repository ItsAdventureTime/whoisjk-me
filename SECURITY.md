# Security and privacy guide

**Reviewed:** 2026-08-22
**Scope:** public whoisjk.me source, contact endpoint, container runtime, and Git release workflow

The 2026-08-08 personal-context review informs the public copy. Only the
non-sensitive, intentionally shareable layer belongs here. The source profile
stays outside this repository.

## Public-content rules

whoisjk.me is a personal website with a privacy-conscious contact endpoint.

- Do not publish an email address or `mailto:` link. Visitors use the protected contact form.
- Do not publish JK’s age or year of birth.
- Use “Philippines,” not a more precise city.
- Keep personal details limited to the content JK intentionally chose to share.
- Do not place credentials, API tokens, private keys, 1Password secrets, or VPS secrets in the repository.
- Keep contact details server-side; the form sends messages through Resend without exposing the destination inbox in page source.

## Repository boundary

Only source, build configuration, public assets, tests, and release guidance
belong in GitHub. The following remain local-only and are ignored:

- `.openai/` — hosting-provider metadata not needed by the VPS deployment.
- `.serena/` — local agent configuration and memories.
- `.agents/` and `skills-lock.json` — local skill installation metadata.
- `.deploy-vps.conf` — local VPS routing details used by the deployment helper.
- `.env*`, private keys, certificates, credentials, generated output, and
  dependency directories.

These paths were removed from Git tracking in the repository cleanup. A local
ignore rule does not remove historical data; if a real secret ever entered Git,
revoke it first and follow GitHub's sensitive-data removal procedure.

## Local scan

Run the build and scan both source files and generated output:

```bash
jk-sbx-project ensure
jk-sbx-project exec ./scripts/sandbox-node.sh node --version
jk-sbx-project exec ./scripts/sandbox-node.sh --with-pnpm sh -c 'CI=true pnpm run check && CI=true pnpm test'
rg -n -i \
  'mailto:|[[:alnum:]._%+-]+@[[:alnum:].-]+\.[[:alpha:]]{2,}' \
  src app public astro.config.mjs package.json
rg -n -i \
  'mailto:|[[:alnum:]._%+-]+@[[:alnum:].-]+\.[[:alpha:]]{2,}' \
  dist
```

The implementation-source scan intentionally excludes Markdown guides and tests,
which document the scan pattern itself. It should produce no email-address or
mailto: matches in the public implementation source.
The rendered-output test separately rejects email-shaped strings and `mailto:`
links in `dist/client/index.html`. Runtime-only sender and recipient values are
injected through Podman secrets and never copied into the image or browser
bundle. A clean result is a release check, not proof that arbitrary personal
data is impossible to add later.

## Contact endpoint

The browser exposes only the public Turnstile site key. The browser submits
same-origin JSON rather than a simple HTML form post, and the endpoint requires
the exact production `Origin` header. The server validates
each token at Cloudflare’s Siteverify endpoint before calling Resend. Tokens
are single-use and short-lived. The endpoint also requires name, country, and
message; caps field and request sizes; rejects a honeypot and implausibly fast
submissions; checks same-origin requests; and throttles repeated attempts by
client address. Resend failures return a short reference instead of provider
details. Server logs retain only that reference, the HTTP status, and a
provider error type; they never retain message content, contact details, or
credentials. Each delivery request also includes a unique Resend idempotency
key.

Create these secrets on the VPS and keep their values out of source control,
container build arguments, logs, and shell history:

```bash
printf '%s' "$TURNSTILE_SECRET_VALUE" | podman secret create iamjk-site_TURNSTILE_SECRET -
printf '%s' "$RESEND_API_KEY_VALUE" | podman secret create iamjk-site_resend-api-key -
printf '%s' "$RESEND_FROM_VALUE" | podman secret create iamjk-site_resend-from -
printf '%s' "$RESEND_TO_VALUE" | podman secret create iamjk-site_resend-to -
```

The Quadlet template maps these secrets to runtime-only environment variables,
runs with `NoNewPrivileges=true`, drops all Linux capabilities, and uses a
read-only root filesystem with a private `/tmp` tmpfs.
Do not publish port `4321`; Caddy should reverse-proxy to `iamjk-site:4321`
over `caddy.network` and preserve the public host with `header_up Host {host}`.
The JSON request avoids Astro’s form-origin check being confused by the HTTP
hop between Caddy and the Node adapter. Astro’s `security.checkOrigin: true`
remains enabled for other form-like SSR requests; do not disable it as a
general workaround for proxy configuration.
The Caddy site block must also mark `/api/*` as `private, no-store` and set
`CDN-Cache-Control: no-store` so contact responses cannot be cached at the edge.
It must cap the `/api/*` request body at `16KB` before proxying, matching the
application limit and preventing oversized uploads from reaching Astro.
The deployment helper adds this matcher idempotently when
`DEPLOY_UPDATE_CADDY="1"` (the default) and
backs up the shared Caddyfile before changing it. Review the backup and validate
the full shared Caddyfile before reloading Caddy.
Because the Caddy Quadlet mounts `/etc/caddy` read-only, formatting uses a
temporary rootless Podman container with only the Caddy config directory mounted
read-write. The formatter uses `--user 0 --userns=host` so rootless Podman maps
the process to the VPS user who owns the host files. It omits `:Z` because the
permanent Quadlet has already labeled this shared directory; a second private
relabel can make the live Caddy container lose read access. The temporary
formatter/validator has no network access and disables SELinux separation only
for this narrow host-file operation. The helper repairs an existing unreadable
live mount by restarting the Caddy Quadlet, then validates through
`podman exec caddy caddy validate`; normal configuration changes still reach
the running container only through a graceful `caddy reload`.

## Git history

The scan above checks the current checkout and generated output. It does not
rewrite old Git history. If a real email address, credential, token, or private
key was ever committed:

1. stop publishing the affected branch;
2. rotate or revoke any credential immediately;
3. identify affected commits and remote copies;
4. choose history rewriting only after confirming the impact on collaborators and
   deployments.

Never treat deleting the current file as remediation for an exposed secret.

## GitHub protection

Enable GitHub Secret Protection and push protection for the repository when the
account and repository plan support them. GitHub’s push protection is designed to
block supported secrets before they reach the repository. It complements, but
does not replace, this project’s email/privacy scan.

Review any push-protection alert instead of bypassing it automatically. A real
credential must be rotated or revoked before the commit is republished.

GitHub CLI is the required authentication path for GitHub remote operations.
Keep `origin` on HTTPS; do not use the SSH remote for pushes. Confirm the active
account, configure Git to use GitHub CLI credentials, verify the remote, then
push the local commit:

```bash
gh auth status
gh auth setup-git --hostname github.com
 gh repo view ItsAdventureTime/whoisjk-me --json nameWithOwner,defaultBranchRef
 git remote set-url origin https://github.com/ItsAdventureTime/whoisjk-me.git
git add <reviewed-files>
git diff --cached --check
git commit -S -m "Describe the change"
git verify-commit HEAD
git push origin main
```

`git add` and `git commit` create the local release commit. `gh auth status`
and `gh auth setup-git` establish the authenticated GitHub CLI credential, and
`git push` publishes over the HTTPS remote. Do not use an SSH GitHub remote or
`gh repo sync` for this workflow. `gh repo sync` synchronizes from a source
repository; it is not the normal command for publishing local commits.

`gh auth setup-git` configures GitHub CLI credentials for Git transport; it does
not create a cryptographic signature. Commit signing is separate from remote
transport; if signing is enabled, verification comes from the signed commit, the
registered signing public key, and the matching GitHub author email. A failed
signing agent must not be worked around by publishing private key material.

The normal post-update contract is documented in
[`RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md`](RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md). It requires the Docker Sandbox
validation gate, updated project guides where behavior or commands changed, an
HTTPS `origin`, and a verified signed commit before publication. GitHub CLI
cannot create the local Git index or commit object by itself; it supplies the
authenticated HTTPS credential for Git transport and verifies the remote commit
after publication. Do not interpret “gh-only” as permission to skip local
signature verification or to publish an unsigned commit.

## Signing key handling

The current macOS checkout has an SSH-based 1Password signer configuration, but
SSH signing is not the normal release path under the project’s HTTPS-only,
no-SSH-key policy. Do not invoke that signer for a release. Configure an
approved non-SSH signer, such as GPG or S/MIME, and register its public key with
the matching GitHub account before publishing.

Check the effective local signing configuration without printing secrets:

```bash
git config --show-origin --get-regexp \
  '^(commit\.gpgsign|user\.signingkey|gpg\.format|gpg\.ssh\.program)$'
git log -1 --show-signature
```

GitHub can show a commit as verified only after the matching public key is
registered in the GitHub account’s **Signing keys** and the commit author email
matches the account. Do not copy private key material into the repository or
shell history. See [`RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md`](RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md) for the required
stop condition when no approved signer is available.

## Deployment check

The canonical release path runs tests and the target-platform image build
through the project Docker Sandbox, transfers one saved release-image archive
to the VPS, lets rootless Podman load the image, restarts the application
Quadlet, gracefully reloads the running Caddy configuration only after
formatting and validation, and then invokes the VPS-side bunny-purge script
over SSH. The local `.dockerignore` keeps `.env` files, `.deploy-vps.conf`,
private-key/certificate files, generated output, and local agent metadata out
of the image build context. The VPS does not build or compile the application.
Before purging the CDN, it checks the new contact markup internally and confirms the public
`GET /api/contact` route returns `405 Method Not Allowed`, proving Caddy
reaches the Node endpoint.

Run the one-time local setup from the repository root:

~~~bash
cd ~/dev/iamjk-site
./scripts/deploy-vps.sh --init
~~~

Then deploy later updates with:

~~~bash
./scripts/deploy-vps.sh
~~~

The helper runs the project checks and image build before rsync. If diagnosing it manually, run
the source and generated-output privacy scan after the container build:

~~~bash
rg -n -i 'mailto:|[[:alnum:]._%+-]+@[[:alnum:].-]+\.[[:alpha:]]{2,}' dist
~~~

The final scan should return no matches. Caddy’s CSP must allow the compiled
same-origin Astro module while keeping inline event handlers disabled. See
`README.md` for the Podman, rsync, bunny-purge, Caddy, and VPS instructions.
